VX2 BIOS Diagnostic Codes

Numbers in this document are hexadecimal, unless otherwise indicated.

Codes are written as either 16-bit I/O writes to port 0CF8h or as 8-bit writes
to ports 0CF8h and 0CF9h.

D = Original code description from service manual, appendix B.
N = Explanatory note describing actual BIOS behaviour.
U = Undocumented code.

Code
Hi/Lo	? Description
─────	─ ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
01.01	D Processor clocks OK after jump to 0FFFF:00AB
	N No actual test performed: CPU jumping from reset vector is enough to
	  get this code.  The reference to CS:IP reaching 0FFFF:00AB is
	  incorrect: this is outside the real-mode address space.  The actual
	  end of this test is at 0F000:00AB.
	N Low byte of code is immediately replaced by the shutdown reason read
	  from CMOS register 0Fh.
01.02	D Reset interrupt controller on 3010
	N 3010 refers to the Feraday FE3010.
	N Both PIC1 and PIC2 are initialized in IBM-compatible mode.
01.03	D Reset maths co-processor
